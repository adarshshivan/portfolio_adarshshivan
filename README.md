# Portfolio (basic template)

This is a minimal static portfolio template for Adarsh.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main page with sections (hero, about, projects, contact)
- `styles.css` — simple responsive styles
- `script.js` — small JS for mobile nav and footer year

How to use
1. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or drag into browser).
2. Edit the content in the HTML file to add your real projects, images, and text.

Next steps (we can do next):
- Replace placeholders with real project images and links
- Add a contact form backend or use a mailto/service
- Add animations, portfolio filters, or a resume download

If you want, tell me which section to customize first (design, projects, about, contact) and I'll update it.
